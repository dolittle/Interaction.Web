        <h3>IMPORTANT: Due to HTML already having a node type called <b>link</b> - this is prefixed with <b>f</b> making it called <b>flink</b></h3>
    </p>
    <p>
        When a link has an href,{' '}
        <flink href="http://dev.office.com/fabric/components/link">it renders as an anchor tag.</flink> Without an
        href,{' '}
        <flink>the link is rendered as a button</flink>. You can also use the disabled attribute to create a{' '}
        <flink disabled href="http://dev.office.com/fabric/components/link">
        disabled link.
        </flink>
    </p>
    <p>
        It's not recommended to use Links with imgs because Links are meant to render textual inline content.
        Buttons
        are inline-block or in the case of imgs, block. However, it is possible to create a linked image button by
        making a button with an unstyled variant and adding the img content and href source to that.
